## CodeRabbit Review Loop

This is an automated review loop. Follow these steps:

### 1. Wait for CodeRabbit CI to complete
Run `pnpm review:wait` to poll for CodeRabbit CI completion.
- Waits 10s for CI to start (in case called right after push)
- Polls every 15s until CI completes
- Times out after 10 minutes
- Exits immediately if no CI is in progress

### 2. Fetch and address comments
Once CI completes:
1. Run `pnpm review:comments` to fetch comments into `.reviews/prComments.md`
2. Review all comments critically - not all may be valid or apply to our codebase
3. ASK BACK the user for decisions if needed before implementing fixes
4. Address valid issues
5. Resolve threads via the `gh api graphql` mutation shown in the file (in both cases, if you addressed or rejected it)

### 3. Verify and commit
1. Run `pnpm review:comments` to verify no unresolved comments remain
2. Run `pnpm check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build` to ensure code quality
3. Commit and push changes

### 4. Loop
Go back to step 1 - wait for the next CodeRabbit review triggered by the push.

**Exit condition**: When `pnpm review:comments` shows no comments. Give a brief high level summary of what was addressed.
